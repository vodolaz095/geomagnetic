Geomagnetic
======================================
Parser for getting Earth magnetic field parameters from
Space Weather Prediction Center -

Description
======================================
This is simple pure nodejs data scrapper, that grabs data primary and secondary
[Goes Magnetometers](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/goes-magnetometer)
and parses them as array.

Usage
======================================

```javascript

    var geomagnetic = require('geomagnetic');
    geomagnetic.getPrimary(function(err,data){
      if(err) throw err;
      console.log(data);
    });
    geomagnetic.getSecondary(function(err,data){
      if(err) throw err;
      console.log(data);
    });


```

will return something like:

```javascript

     [
      { timestamp: 1399158180000,
        time: Sun May 04 2014 03:03:00 GMT+0400 (MSK),
        Hp: 63.7,
        He: 75.2,
        Hn: -7.73,
        total: 98.8,
        units: 'nanotesla (nT)'
      },
      { timestamp: 1399158240000,
        time: Sun May 04 2014 03:04:00 GMT+0400 (MSK),
        Hp: 64.4,
        He: 76.2,
        Hn: -9.04,
        total: 100,
        units: 'nanotesla (nT)'
      },
      { timestamp: 1399158300000,
        time: Sun May 04 2014 03:05:00 GMT+0400 (MSK),
        Hp: 64.5,
        He: 77.1,
        Hn: -9.51,
        total: 101,
        units: 'nanotesla (nT)'
      }
     ]

```

The data is an array of objects with 4 fields:

  `timestamp` - unix timestamp of moment when current measures are taken

  `time` - javascript object of Date of moment when current measures are taken

  `Hp` - component perpendicular to the satellite orbital plane or parallel to the Earth's spin axis

  `He` -  component perpendicular to Hp and directed earthwards

  `Hn` - component perpendicular to both Hp and He, directed eastwards

  `total` - absolute value of magnetic field  - sqrt(Hp^2+He^2+Hn^2).

All data have units in `nanoteslas` - nT.

Note 1: `total` is probably measured by omni directional solenoid system,
not counted from He, Hp, Hn, so there is <5% discrepance.

Note 2: sometimes there is -100000 values for magnetic fields magnitutes.
This is probably the error in data transfer or a way to show that data was
not properly acquired. So, the user of library can simply negate this values.
